\section{About}

This paper\cite{Montero2024} addresses the challenge of learning adaptable and generalizable representations in Learning from Demonstration (LfD), focusing on multi-reference frame skill learning, without using any task-specific heuristics.
The approach proposes learning local policies by fitting relative skills in each reference frame using Gaussian Processes (GPs), while also learning the relevance of each reference frame for every time step using another GP, in a self-supervised manner.
